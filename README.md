### Visualization Workflow

1.Agenda: To provide the users with relatable information about the android market of google play store and give insights for developers on areas which needs improvement. 
2.Refining Data:  Necessary formatting has been done to the data set, which helped us in smooth plotting in R .
3.Editorial thinking: I want the audience to benefit by knowing the information about each app and which is doing better, and which is not. Additionally, the developers may also focus on the apps that need improvement based on the reviews and ratings on the apps. To achieve the same, I have considered variables relationship and depicted the correlation.
4.Design Solution: I have come up with 3 static, 3 animated and 2 interactive charts to narrate the story of GooglePlayStoreApps
